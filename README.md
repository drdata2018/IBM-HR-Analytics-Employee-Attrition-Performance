# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance


This is a dataset created by IBM data scientists to analyze the factors that lead to employee attrition. In this notebook, we will be building a system that predicts employee attrition. First, we will do some preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and then we will build and compare 3 different classification models. There will be comments every step of the way so there is a clear understanding.
